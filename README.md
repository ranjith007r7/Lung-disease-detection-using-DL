This drive link includes Training & Testing image dataset and untrained dataset for validation purpose


Hello all,

This folder contains my final year project on detecting the type of lung disease using deep learning method.

I have used InceptionV3 algorithm Inception v3 is a convolutional neural network for assisting in image analysis and object detection, 

I have also uploaded the training and testing image dataset with the names train & test respectively

I have also uploaded the untrained image dataset for validation purpose which will be found in the name of untrained new dataset

The main code file is named as "lung.ipynb" 

The trained code will be saved in the .h5 format "finalmodel.h5"

The webpage file is as follow "templates/index.html"

The flask file is named as "main.py"

By calling the flask file in the command prompt using the code "python main.py" It generates the local IP Address (http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

By clicking on that ip address you can access the webpage where you can upload the image you want to check and detect the type of lung disease

I have also uploaded some sample output images and workflow images for your clarifications

I have also uploaded the ppt & Report of my project in this repository

Hope you all like it Thank You!
